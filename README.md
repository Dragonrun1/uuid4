UUID v4 (random) Typescript/Javascript package with a custom base 64 encoding added.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install uuid4.

```bash
npm i @dragonrun1/uuid64ts
```

## Usage

```typescript
import {Uuid4} from 'Uuid4';

const MyUuid4 = new Uuid4();
const base64 = MyUuid4.asBase64();
const bin = MyUuid4.asBinString();
const hex = MyUuid4.asHexString();
const uuid = MyUuid4.asUuid();
console.log('base64:');
console.log(base64);
console.log('bin:');
console.log(bin);
console.log('hex:');
console.log(hex);
console.log('uuid:');
console.log(uuid);
```

## Why make this project?

If this project was just another UUID v4 (random) library there would be
little point as there are already several fine ones out there for Typescript and
Javascript, but where they just do UUIDs this project targets being used with
databases as a primary key. To really understand the fuller background without
me having to reproduce it all here I'll just direct you to the PHP project that
inspired this one to be created:

[uuid64type](https://github.com/Dragonrun1/uuid64type)

There you will find a few paragraphs on why I started it and why I think a base
64 encoded UUID v4 has many benefits.

The project that this project was made to be a translation of but ended up
causing a large re-write which became __uuid64type__'s version 2.0.
